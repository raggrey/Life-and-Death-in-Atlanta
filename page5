						<p>“Badge and ID, <ins>please</ins>,” the officer says derisively. “And let’s have a look at that case, too.”  It looks like this new guy is taking his job pretty seriously. You don’t have time for this. With an unintentional sigh, you open the briefcase full of parts and papers with the knowledge he won’t understand them.
						He squares his shoulders, “You want to explain what all this stuff is?”<br> You raise an eyebrow. Why the interest? Usually you can get through security checks like this with a lame joke.
